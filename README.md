===== Minecraft: MCBBS Edition =====

I am busy lately, so this project will not be updated. (Unless I am very free)

---

What is this for?

This is a resource pack for Minecraft: Java Edition (version 1.15+).

It's just for fun, no practical use.

---

What did this thing do?

It modifies the names of "items" and "creatures" in Minecraft, and some others.

Of course, these modified names are borrowed from some MCBBS (www.mcbbs.net) users.

---

some problems

Can I use this resource pack to make an introduction video?

of course can! Someone has already done it, of course you can do it again :)


Would you consider supporting more languages?

Not for the time being.


Update frequency?

See if I am busy! ~~(Although sometimes it doesn’t update even if it’s not busy)~~
